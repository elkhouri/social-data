Design Principles
--------------
- Feedback
  - Loading spinners in place of data while data is fetched from the server via an Ajax request to indicate something is happening.
  - On hover, names of individuals are highlighted as the nodes expand.

- Visibility
  - Everything that is interactable the user can see on the screen.

- Constraint
  - Data that is not available because the user hasn't logged in is hidden from the user.

- Mapping
  - The active tab indicator indicates where the user is and the other tabs indicate where the user can go.

- Consistency
  - All the data are organized into tabs.
  
- Affordance
  - Navigating through tabs affords easy access of different types of data
  - The graph enables interaction (dragging, hovering)
  
- Mental/conceptual Models
  - Previous knowledge of how tabs work; clicking one allows a new page of content to appear
  - Need to have an understanding of how data is mapped on a graph in order to interact with it
  - Knowledge of tables and how variables and values map to one another (Avg Statuses a Day ; 0.03)
  
  
  
Social Network Analysis Parameters
  --------------
- Degree Centrality 
  - Displays the user's number of direct relationships with people who have liked their statuses.

- Closeness Centrality
  - Shows the varying degrees of closeness between other entities, based on the occurrence of likes on the user's statuses.
  Thus, nodes that are closer than others have shorter paths to the central user node.
  - The user has higher visibility of what occurs to the entities that like their statuses more often. This is also true in the case of facebook in that the people you interact with more often have a greater presence within your feed and profile.
