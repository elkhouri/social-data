Design Principles
--------------
- Feedback
  - Loading spinners in place of data while data is fetched from the server via an Ajax request to indicate something is happening.

- Visibility
  - Everything that is interactable the user can see on the screen.

- Constraint
  - Data that is not available because the user hasn't logged in is hidden from the user.

- Mapping
  - The active tab indicator indicates where the user is and the other tabs indicate where the user can go.

- Consistency
  - All the data are organized into tabs.
